        many challenges and problems like climate change and increased vacancy
        and poverty. Increased temperature may increase the frequency and length
        of extreme heat events. In Midtown, those communities with less canopy
        coverage, imperviousness, high-density population, and poverty could
        suffer more from extreme heat.</p>

          design is focusing on climate resiliency, more access to nature, and
          sustainability on the abandoned sites or vacant lots. This project
          proposed a vacancy reuse strategy to provide a solution to these
          problems by designing a public vacancy lot an open tree farm/nursery,
          which can not only provide ecological services like street trees,
          shade area, and infiltration for the urban environment but also share
          the place for local residents to understand and enjoy the sustainable
          landscape. The design comes up with two main strategies to achieve the
          design goal:</p>
        <p style="font-family: Avenir;font-size:1vw; font-weight:lighter;">1.
          Using infrastructures and terrain to support sustainable plantation
          and public activities;</p>
        <p style="font-family: Avenir;font-size:1vw; font-weight:lighter;">2.
          Rotating plantation plan and involve public activity in the rotation
          to provide leisure spaces for residents and also allow residents to
          perceive and understand plantation dynamics.</p>
